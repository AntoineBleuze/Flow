## Page 1

Deliver your web browser as a browser app and a collection of extensions, described in Designing
your browser architecture. Create a separate target in your Xcode project for each of the three
kinds of extension: web content extension, rendering extension, and networking extension.
Create a new Xcode project for your browser app and extensions:
1. In Xcode, choose File > New Project.
2. Select the iOS App template, and click Next.
3. Give your project a name, and click Next.
4. Choose a location to save your project, and click Create.
Open your Xcode project, and follow these steps for each of the three extension types:
1. Select your Xcode project in the Project Navigator.
2. Click the Add (+) button at the bottom of the targets list.
3. Select the iOS Generic Extension template, and click Next.
4. Give the extension a name, and ensure your browser app is chosen for the Embed in Applicatio
setting.
5. Click Finish, then cancel the request to activate the extension target’s scheme.

6. Select the new target in the Project Editor.
7. Switch to the Info tab.
8. Expand the disclosure triangle next to EXAppExtensionAttributes.
9. Edit the value for EXExtensionPointIdentifier, and enter the appropriate value from the
list based on the extension type:
Rendering extension
com.apple.web-browser-engine.rendering
Networking extension
com.apple.web-browser-engine.networking
Content extension
com.apple.web-browser-engine.content
Browser apps that include alternative browser engines must use the arm64e instruction set for al
executables, including the extensions, in order to use the operating system’s pointer-authenticati
protection on devices that support it. Build your browser app as a universal binary that also
supports the arm64 instruction set to target iPad models that support alternative browser engine
and don’t support arm64e instructions.
Important
You can develop and test your alternative browser engine using the arm64 instruction set. To
distribute your browser that includes an alternative browser engine, you need to support the
arm64e instruction set.
To configure your Xcode targets to use the arm64e instruction set:
1. Select the Xcode project in the Project Navigator.
2. Select your target.
3. Open the Build Settings Tab.
4. Click the disclosure button to the left of the Architectures build setting.
5. Click the Add (+) button that appears when you move the mouse pointer over the Debug build
configuration.
6. Change the SDK in the new row from “Any SDK” to “iOS”.
7. Enter the value arm64e for the build setting for the iOS SDK.
8. Repeat steps 5-7 for the Release build configuration.

9. Repeat steps 2-8 for each target in your browser app project.
Alternatively, if you use Xcode configuration files to manage build settings for your targets, add th
line to your configuration file:
Important
Don’t build your target with the arm64e instruction set for Simulator destinations. Simulator
for iPhone doesn’t support arm64e instructions.
If your Xcode workspace includes Swift Packages as dependencies for your targets, use workspa
settings to build the packages using the arm64e instruction set. In Terminal, run these command
To act as a person’s web browser, your app requires the default-browser entitlement (see Prepari
your app to be the default web browser), and the Web Browser Engine Entitlement that
enables your app to separate core tasks of an alternative browser engine into dedicated
extensions.
Adopt the correct entitlements

Note
Apps that aren’t browsers that use an alternative browser engine for in-app browsing need to
add the Embedded Browser Engine Entitlement and Embedded Browser Engine
Association Entitlement rather than the default-browser entitlement and Web
Browser Engine Entitlement.
In addition, an app that isn’t a browser needs to include:
The alternative browser engine in its own executable or as a dynamic library
The BEEmbeddedWebBrowserEngine and BEEmbeddedWebBrowserEngineVersion
keys in its target properties
embedded-web-browser-engine in its UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities target
property
The embedded alternative browser only needs to use the arm64 instruction set (not arm64e).
It can’t include any web browser extensions or use just-in-time (JIT) compilation.
Each of your browser app’s extensions need to add the the following entitlements with a value of
true:
Rendering extension
com.apple.developer.web-browser-engine.rendering
Network extension
com.apple.developer.web-browser-engine.networking
Content extension
com.apple.developer.web-browser-engine.webcontent
To use the extension entitlements, compile your host app and extensions with the arm64e
instruction set.
In Japan, browser apps are required to enable hardware memory tagging (see Enable Hardwar
Memory Tagging). To protect your users, Apple also strongly recommends that browser apps
enable memory tagging in the European Union.
In addition, you can optionally add the following entitlements:
To allow JIT compilation of website scripts, your content extension uses the Allow executio
of JIT-compiled code entitlement entitlement with a value of true, and Extended
Virtual Addressing Entitlement with a value of true. For more information, see
Protecting code compiled just in time. You can’t give this entitlement to your browser app,
rendering extension, or networking extension.
To transfer memory attribution between extensions, your content extension uses the com
.apple.developer.memory.transfer_accept entitlement, and your rendering extensio

uses the com.apple.developer.memory.transfer_send entitlement, both with the
browser apps’ bundle identifier as the value. For more information, see Attributing memory to a
content extension.
To restrict access to the system notification service in your web content extension, add the co
.apple.developer.web-browser-engine.restrict.notifyd entitlement with the
value true. For more information, see Limiting resource access in web content extensions.
For more information on adding entitlements to targets in Xcode, see Entitlements.
Important
App Store Connect won’t accept your app if your non-browser app includes any of the
entitlements for web browsers and their extensions described in this section, or you use the
entitlements on other web browser components or with different values than those listed here.
You must use all of the entitlements listed here only for the purposes described, for the
relevant components of your browser app.
Add the string web-browser-engine to the UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities array in you
target’s properties, to ensure that people can only download your app on devices that support
browser apps with alternative browser engines. If your browser app only supports the arm64e
instruction set, also add arm64e to UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities.
For more information, see Required Device Capabilities.
Development of a web browser that uses an alternative browser engine can occur anywhere in the
world. Xcode allows running development or Ad-Hoc signed builds of the app on Simulator but
device support varies by region:
European Union
Alternative browser engines support iPhone and iPad.
Japan
Alternative browser engines support iPhone.
