## Page 1

AdAttributionKit and SKAdNetwork are frameworks that enable ad attribution and user
engagement measurement for conversions. AdAttributionKit works with both the App Store and
alternative app marketplaces, while SKAdNetwork works specifically with the App Store.
The update API to call depends on the framework your ad network is using, although you can use
both APIs:
If your framework is integrated with AdAttributionKit, use the updateConversionValue(_:
coarseConversionValue:lockPostback:) or updateConversionValue(_:lock
Postback:) API methods. If your framework is integrated with SKAdNetwork, call the update
PostbackConversionValue(_:coarseValue:lockWindow:completionHandler:) or
updatePostbackConversionValue(_:coarseValue:completionHandler:) API
methods.
If your framework is integrated with both AdAttributionKit and SKAdNetwork, call APIs from both. 
your app doesn’t have any pending postbacks — for instance because a person hasn’t seen an ad
for your app — the system ignores calls to both AdAttributionKit and SKAdNetwork. Additionally,
.adattributionkit and .skadnetwork ad network IDs are compatible across both
AdAttributionKit and SKAdNetwork, so you don’t need a specific ad network ID for one or the othe

If an app has both AdAttributionKit and SKAdNetwork impressions, the system sorts both of them
and decides the winner. Only one impression can win for a conversion, whether it comes from
AdAttributionKit or SKAdNetwork. If a person sees more than one advertisement, the attribution
goes to the ad the person most recently tapped. If a person doesn’t tap any ads, attribution goes 
the ad a person most recently viewed.
The system sorts the impressions based on the following criteria:
Whether they are click-through or view-through. Click-through ads always take precedence ov
view-through ads.
For impressions, in each click-through or view-through group, the system sorts them based on
their timestamp.
The system considers a maximum of six impressions for any conversion.
When an app calls the update conversion values APIs in SKAdNetwork, such as updatePostbac
ConversionValue(_:coarseValue:lockWindow:completionHandler:), SKAdNetwork
bridges the conversion values between the two frameworks by mirroring the call into
AdAttributionNetwork by calling
updateConversionValue(_:lockPostback:).
Presenting ads in your app
Render different ad styles in your app.
Receiving ad attributions and postbacks
Understand timeframes and priorities for ad impressions that result in ad attributions, and ho
impressions qualify for postbacks.
Identifying conversion values with conversion tags
Use conversion tags to identify and update specific postbacks when you have overlapping
conversion windows.
